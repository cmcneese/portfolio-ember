              <h1>Final Project - Etch</h1>

              <p>
                The culmination of The Iron Yard came down to our final project. We were to pitch ideas for our projects and had some guidelines: had to be a CRUD web app, yet be a Minimal Viable Product within a three week timetable.</p>
              <p> Kudos to all of my cohort! They all had fantastic and creative ideas! I was so surprised that an idea I pitched got selected. I had the honor of working with a great partner who LOVES design. Our app is called Etch, and the idea was to tag
              </p>
              a memory to a song. The app can be found <a href="http://etch-memories.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

              <h1>Flexbox Practice</h1>

              <p>
                I remember how challenging and difficult I found making "boxes" to be on a page. Once my perspective was changed, and I learned a new way to look at boxes and breaking each portion up into a separate section, giving each item it's own container. However,
                with this assignment being a grid, I quickly learned to focus on just making one box to create this blog, and then to just copy and paste to however many posts are needed.

              <h1>Github Mockup</h1>

              <p>
                We were assigned homework to recreate a mockup of Github, in which also gave me the opportunity to explore Github a bit more. Becoming a new developer, Github is a very central tool for me to be able to save code of applications, projects of any kind
                for that matter, to an external server that also allows for public contribution from other developers. As you will notice in the screenshot, this assignment also involved boxes in a grid-layout. I'm not really sure I can explain it, but
                for some reason grids and boxes were not my friend. Fortunately, I was able to have more practice and get very familiar with laying out boxes in grid formats.

              <h1>Surf & Paddle</h1>

              <p>
                Surf & Paddle was rather a much bigger assignment. Usually, our assignments tasked to us over the weekends entailed a much greater challenge and involved more to be completed. The screenshot only shows a portion of the page, but if you'll notice, it looks
                very similar to a personal lifestyle, or even travel blog. Getting the concept of building a website around a "Hero", or one main image as the focal point of what is seen once the page is loaded in.
